Build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package.

This action uses the [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) container to
build manylinux wheels for a (Cython) Python package. The wheels are placed in a
new directory `wheelhouse` and can then be uploaded to PyPI in the next step of your workflow.

## Usage

### Inputs

#### python-versions (required)
Python versions for which to build (PEP 425 tags), as described in the
[manylinux image documentation](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux). This can be
one version, or a space-separated list of items.

For example: `cp36-cp36m cp37-cp37m cp38-cp38`  
Default: `cp36-cp36m cp37-cp37m cp38-cp38`

Possible version tags (as of the 12th of December 2019): `cp27-cp27m`, `cp27-cp27mu`,
`cp34-cp34m`, `cp35-cp35m`, `cp36-cp36m`, `cp37-cp37m`, `cp38-cp38`

#### manylinux-image (optional)
Manylinux image to use. Check the
[manylinux image documentation](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux#docker-images) for all
available manylinux images.

For example: `manylinux1_x86_64`, or `manylinux2014_x86_64`  
Default: `manylinux2010_x86_64`

#### build-requirements (optional)
Packages required at build time, space-separated  
For example: `cython` or `cython==0.29.14`

## Output
The action will create wheels in a new `wheelhouse` directory. Be sure to upload
only the `wheelhouse/*-manylinux*.whl` wheels, as the non-audited `linux_x86_64` wheels
are not accepted by PyPI.

### Example usage
```yaml
uses: actions/python-wheels-manylinux-build@v0.1
with:
  python-versions: 'cp36-cp36m cp37-cp37m'
  manylinux-image: 'manylinux2010_x86_64'
  build-requirements: 'cython numpy'
```

for a complete example that includes linting and uploading to PyPI.
